# Shane McNeill

## Experienced Videographer

Hello! My name is Shane McNeill. I am a passionate pop culture and sports nerd who is motivated to find and tell one-of-a-kind stories. I believe strongly that film and video campture is much more than two-dimensional medium, and when done well, can captivate, motivate, and elevate the best in everyone.

I am constantly learning and practicing various specialties of film to help me become a better artist and more confident in my work. I take pride in my variety of work for capturing different individual stories and showcasing local brands and community organizations. In June of 2022, I past a major milestone of graduating with a bachelor's degree in Film from Portland State University.

I've worked in a variety of work environments, including on-set and in live events, and have produced online content for notable and respected organzations.

To contact me about helping you capture your story, email me at <a href="mailto:sfm.creativemedia@gmail.com">sfm.creativemedia@gmail.com</a>.

These social media posts were informative and helped build anticipation with our growing social media followers. When it came time for Portland State's TEDx event in October of 2020, I led all facets of the filming process, including setting up audio equipment inside the theater, lighting the stage, and even shooting behind-the-scenes footage. I then edited the TEDx talks into individual videos and posted them on the official TEDx YouTube page during the post-production process."
